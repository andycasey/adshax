**Create awesome visualisations using data from NASA's ADS**
============================================================

Dolla, dolla bill.

**Getting Started**

1. You'll need an API key from NASA ADS labs. You can apply for one [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFJZbHp1WERWU3hQVVJnZFJjbE05SGc6MQ#gid=0).

2. When you get your API key, save it to a file called ``~/.ads/dev_key`` or save it as an environment variable named ``ADS_DEV_KEY``

3. Clone the repository and hack away.
